# DevOps Code RealTime
Code RealTime lets you create stateful, event-driven realtime applications in C++. It is available as an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=secure-dev-ops.code-realtime-ce) and [Eclipse Theia](https://open-vsx.org/extension/secure-dev-ops/code-realtime-ce). 

## Code RealTime's Three A:s of Value
- Abstraction
  - The **Art language** provides powerful high-level concepts such as capsules, state machines, ports and events
  - View and edit your application using **graphical diagrams** such as state, structure and class diagrams
  - Use **logical threads** to avoid hard-coding your application against certain physical threads
- Automation
  - Efficient **C++ code** is automatically generated
  - **Build variants** enable high-level build settings, and application variant management
  - Diagrams are automatically rendered using **auto-layout**
- Analysis
  - **Semantic validation** "as-you-type" for early problem detection (sometimes with quick fixes)
  - Ensure **consistent build settings** by detecting inconsistencies already when editing them
  - Use application **run-time analysis** to detect and troubleshoot run-time problems
